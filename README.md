# Code Analyzer

This repository contains a custom C# code analyzer along with a code fix provider. The analyzer helps maintain consistent naming conventions in C# codebases by detecting naming issues and suggesting automated fixes.

## Overview

The **Code Analyzer** is designed to analyze C# code and provide feedback on naming conventions. It detects issues such as namespaces, classes, interfaces, methods, properties, and fields not adhering to specified naming conventions. Additionally, it offers automated fixes for these issues.

## Features

- **Diagnostic Analyzer**: The analyzer examines various syntax nodes in C# code and reports diagnostics for naming conventions violations.
- **Code Fix Provider**: The code fix provider offers automated solutions to correct the reported naming issues.
- **Customizable**: Users can define their own naming conventions and extend the analyzer to cover additional scenarios.
- **Integration**: The analyzer seamlessly integrates with Visual Studio and provides real-time feedback during code development.

## Getting Started

To use the **Code Analyzer** in your C# projects, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Alifarkhondepey/CodeAnalyzer.git`
2. Build the solution using Visual Studio or the .NET CLI.
3. Reference the analyzer and code fix provider in your C# project.
4. Analyze your code using the provided diagnostic analyzer.
5. Apply automated fixes suggested by the code fix provider to correct naming issues.

## Example

Suppose you have a C# project with inconsistent naming conventions. The **Code Analyzer** can help identify and fix these issues:

```csharp
// Inconsistent namespace naming
namespace myproject
{
    // Inconsistent class naming
    public class myclass
    {
        // Inconsistent method naming
        public void mymethod()
        {
            // Inconsistent property naming
            public int myproperty { get; set; }

            // Inconsistent field naming
            private int myfield;
        }
    }
}
```

After running the analyzer and applying code fixes:

```csharp
// Fixed namespace naming
namespace MyProject
{
    // Fixed class naming
    public class MyClass
    {
        // Fixed method naming
        public void MyMethod()
        {
            // Fixed property naming
            public int MyProperty { get; set; }

            // Fixed field naming
            private int _myField;
        }
    }
}
```

Additionally, for the Medium article, you could write a more in-depth guide explaining the motivation behind creating the analyzer, the process of designing and implementing it, and perhaps some real-world examples of how it can be used to improve code quality and maintainability in C# projects. You can also share insights on the challenges faced during development and how you addressed them.
